# source_view

This is a simple utility I wrote while teaching a technical class. The lectures
were structured as live coding sessions, where students would build, together
with the instructor an iPhone app. Often times students would miss some key piece
of code that I wrote and get stuck behind. This command line utility tries
to help with that. It opens a port on your local machine and exposes a simple
website that shows the state of the source code on the instructors machine.

Features include:
- File browser
- Syntax highlighting
- Image preview
